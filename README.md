# Hand-Recognition-System
<div align="justify">Hand recognition system is a biometric system which uses the hand geometry and the palm print to recognize a person. The system first detects some of key landmarks in the hand and extract the Region of Interest (ROI), in our case ; the palm print. Then unique features from the palm print are extracted to create an embedding for the palm. Together with these embeddings and landmarks the system tries to recognize the person.</div>
